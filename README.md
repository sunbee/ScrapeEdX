# Automate web-scraping MIT's website with BeautifulSoup and a User-Agent
## MIT's Analytics Edge 15.071x offered via EdX is a treasure trove of R code and curated data sets for machine learning. This notebook automates web-scraping the course site.

What to use this notebook for:
- Scrape content from a website with the URL with BeautifulSoup
- Set up a User-Agent to mimic a browser as most websites will block other routes to download files
- Process text for pattern-matching with Perl-like regex

The approach can easily be modified for web-scraping in other contexts. Note that I recommend compliance with the terms of use and good citizenship when downloading content off the web.
